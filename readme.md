Of course! This is an excellent syllabus for a Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. It covers all the fundamental paradigms and important problems. I will break down each unit, explaining the concepts in detail, and then provide worked-out examples for the specific topics you requested.

Let's get you ready for your end-semester exam.

***

### **Syllabus Breakdown and Concepts**

#### **[Unit 1] Introduction to Algorithms [7 Hours]**

This unit sets the foundation for the entire course. It's about defining what an algorithm is and, more importantly, how we measure and compare its efficiency.

*   **Definition & Properties of Algorithms:** An algorithm is a finite, well-defined sequence of steps to solve a problem. Key properties:
    *   **Input:** It takes zero or more inputs.
    *   **Output:** It produces at least one output.
    *   **Finiteness:** It must terminate after a finite number of steps.
    *   **Definiteness:** Each step must be precise and unambiguous.
    *   **Effectiveness:** Each step must be simple enough to be done by a person with pencil and paper.
*   **Expressing Algorithm & Flowchart:** How we write down an algorithm. This can be through **pseudocode** (a mix of natural language and programming constructs) or a **flowchart** (a graphical representation).
*   **Algorithm Design Techniques:** A preview of the major strategies you'll learn in the course: Divide and Conquer, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, etc.
*   **Performance Analysis of Algorithms:** The core of this unit. We analyze algorithms based on two main resources:
    *   **Time Complexity:** How much time an algorithm takes to run, as a function of the input size (`n`).
    *   **Space Complexity:** How much memory an algorithm uses, as a function of the input size (`n`).
*   **Types of Algorithm's Analysis:** We often consider three cases for complexity:
    *   **Best Case:** The minimum time/space required for a particular input.
    *   **Average Case:** The expected time/space over all possible inputs.
    *   **Worst Case:** The maximum time/space required for any input of a given size. (This is usually the most important).
*   **Order of Growth & Asymptotic Notations:** We don't care about exact nanoseconds, but how the running time *grows* as the input size `n` gets very large.
    *   **Big-O (O):** Upper bound (grows *no faster than*...). Example: `O(n²)`.
    *   **Big-Omega (Ω):** Lower bound (grows *at least as fast as*...). Example: `Ω(n)`.
    *   **Big-Theta (Θ):** Tight bound (grows *at the same rate as*...). Example: `Θ(n log n)`.
*   **Recurrence Relations:** Equations that define a function in terms of itself. They are crucial for analyzing recursive algorithms (like Merge Sort). Example: `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n`.
*   **Methods for Solving Recurrences:**
    *   **Substitution Method:** Guess a solution and use mathematical induction to prove it.
    *   **Iterative Method:** Expand the recurrence and express it as a summation.
    *   **Recursion Tree Method:** A visual way to represent the iterative method.
    *   **Master Theorem:** A powerful "cookbook" method for solving recurrences of the form `T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)`. (See example below).
*   **Heap Sort:** A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a Binary Heap data structure. It has a `Θ(n log n)` worst-case time complexity and is an in-place sort.

---

#### **[Unit 2] Divide and Conquer [7 Hours]**

This is a powerful algorithmic paradigm that involves three steps:
1.  **Divide:** Break the problem into smaller, independent sub-problems of the same type.
2.  **Conquer:** Solve the sub-problems recursively. If they are small enough, solve them directly.
3.  **Combine:** Combine the solutions of the sub-problems to get the solution for the original problem.

*   **Introduction:** The core concept explained above.
*   **Binary Search:** A classic example. To find an element in a *sorted* array, you check the middle element. If it's not the target, you discard half of the array and repeat the process on the remaining half. Complexity: `O(log n)`.
*   **Merge Sort:** A sorting algorithm. It divides the array in half, recursively sorts both halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. Guaranteed `Θ(n log n)` time complexity.
*   **Quick Sort:** Another sorting algorithm. It picks a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays: elements smaller than the pivot and elements larger than the pivot. Then it recursively sorts the sub-arrays. Average case is `Θ(n log n)`, but the worst case is `O(n²)`.
*   **Strassen's Matrix Multiplication:** A method for multiplying matrices faster than the standard `O(n³)` algorithm. It cleverly reduces the number of multiplications needed for sub-matrices. (See example below).

---

#### **[Unit 3] Backtracking [7 Hours]**

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally. It abandons a path ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the path cannot possibly lead to a valid solution. It explores the "state-space tree" of solutions.

*   **Backtracking Concept:** Think of solving a maze. You go down one path. If you hit a dead end, you "backtrack" to the last junction and try a different path.
*   **N-Queens Problem (Four-Queens, Eight-Queens):** The problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
*   **Sum of Subsets Problem:** Find a subset of a given set of numbers whose elements sum up to a specific target value. (See example below).
*   **Graph Colouring Problem:** Assign a color to each vertex of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, using the minimum number of colors. (See example below).
*   **Hamiltonian Cycle:** A path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Backtracking is used to find if such a cycle exists.
*   **Branch and Bound:** A related technique, but generally used for *optimization problems*. While backtracking uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find *any* valid solution, Branch and Bound explores the most promising path first (a "best-first" search) and uses a "bound" to prune sub-trees that cannot produce a better solution than the one already found.
*   **Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP):** An optimization problem. Given a list of cities and the distances between them, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. Branch and Bound is a common way to solve this. (See example below).
*   **15-Puzzle Problem:** A sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The goal is to arrange them in order. Branch and Bound can be used to find the solution with the minimum number of moves. (See example below).

---

#### **[Unit 4] Greedy Algorithms [7 Hours]**

A greedy algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. It makes the *locally optimal choice* at each stage with the hope of finding a *globally optimal solution*. This doesn't work for all problems, but is very fast when it does.

*   **Introduction to Greedy Technique/Method:** The core concept of making the locally optimal choice.
*   **Optimal Merge Patterns:** A problem where you need to merge `n` sorted files into a single sorted file. The greedy approach (similar to Huffman coding) is to always merge the two smallest files first to minimize the total number of record-moves.
*   **Huffman Coding:** A famous greedy algorithm for lossless data compression. It assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies: more frequent characters get shorter codes. (See example below).
*   **Knapsack Problem:** This syllabus likely refers to the **Fractional Knapsack Problem**. You have a knapsack with a weight limit and a set of items, each with a value and a weight. The goal is to maximize the total value. The greedy strategy is to take items with the highest value-to-weight ratio first, taking fractions of items if needed. (The 0/1 Knapsack problem, where you can't take fractions, requires Dynamic Programming).
*   **Activity Selection Problem:** Given a set of activities with start and finish times, select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be performed by a single person. (See example below).
*   **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** A subgraph of a connected, weighted graph that connects all the vertices together with the minimum possible total edge weight, without forming a cycle.
    *   **Prim's Algorithm:** Starts from one vertex and "grows" the MST by adding the cheapest edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside it.
    *   **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Sorts all edges by weight and adds the next cheapest edge as long as it doesn't form a cycle.
*   **Single-Source Shortest Path Algorithm:** Finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
    *   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** The classic greedy algorithm for this problem, but it **only works if all edge weights are non-negative**. (See example below).

---

#### **[Unit 5] Dynamic Programming [7 Hours]**

Dynamic Programming (DP) is used for problems that can be broken down into *overlapping sub-problems*. To avoid re-computing the same sub-problem over and over, DP solves each sub-problem just once and stores its solution in a table (memoization or tabulation).

*   **Introduction & Characteristics:** The two main properties of a problem that suggest a DP solution are:
    1.  **Overlapping Sub-problems:** The same sub-problems are encountered multiple times.
    2.  **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution to the overall problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its sub-problems.
*   **Comparison of Divide-and-Conquer and Dynamic Programming:**
    *   **D&C:** Sub-problems are *independent* (e.g., Merge Sort sorting the left half doesn't affect sorting the right half).
    *   **DP:** Sub-problems are *overlapping* (e.g., calculating Fibonacci(5) and Fibonacci(4) both require calculating Fibonacci(3)).
*   **Longest Common Sub-sequence (LCS):** Given two sequences, find the longest sub-sequence present in both. A sub-sequence's elements must appear in the same order, but not necessarily contiguously. (See example below).
*   **Matrix Chain Multiplication:** Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way (minimum number of scalar multiplications) to multiply them. The order matters.
*   **Shortest Paths:**
    *   **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** A single-source shortest path algorithm that is slower than Dijkstra's but has the advantage of working with graphs that have **negative edge weights**. It can also detect negative-weight cycles. (See example below).
    *   **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** An **All-Pairs Shortest Path** algorithm. It finds the shortest paths between *every pair* of vertices in the graph. It also works with negative edge weights (but not negative cycles). (See example below).
*   **NP-Completeness:** A very important theoretical computer science topic.
    *   **Class P:** The set of problems that can be **solved** in polynomial time (`O(n^k)`). These are considered "easy" or "tractable".
    *   **Class NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial):** The set of problems for which a given solution can be **verified** in polynomial time. All problems in P are also in NP.
    *   **Class NP-Complete:** The "hardest" problems in NP. If you could find a polynomial-time algorithm for any *one* NP-Complete problem, you could solve *all* NP problems in polynomial time. Examples include TSP and Graph Colouring.
    *   **Polynomial-Time Reduction:** The process of proving a problem is NP-Complete by showing that a known NP-Complete problem can be transformed into it in polynomial time.

### **Detailed Examples**

Here are the detailed examples you requested.

#### **1. Master Theorem Example**

The Master Theorem solves recurrences of the form `T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)`.
Compare `f(n)` with `n^(log_b a)`.

*   **Case 1:** If `f(n) = O(n^(log_b a - ε))` for some `ε > 0`, then `T(n) = Θ(n^(log_b a))`.
*   **Case 2:** If `f(n) = Θ(n^(log_b a))`, then `T(n) = Θ(n^(log_b a) * log n)`.
*   **Case 3:** If `f(n) = Ω(n^(log_b a + ε))` for some `ε > 0`, and `a*f(n/b) ≤ c*f(n)` for some `c < 1` and large `n`, then `T(n) = Θ(f(n))`.

**Example:** Analyze Merge Sort: `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)`.
1.  **Identify parameters:** `a = 2`, `b = 2`, `f(n) = n`.
2.  **Calculate critical exponent:** `n^(log_b a) = n^(log_2 2) = n^1 = n`.
3.  **Compare:** `f(n) = n` is `Θ(n)`. This matches our calculated `n^(log_2 2)`.
4.  **Conclusion:** This is **Case 2**. Therefore, the solution is `T(n) = Θ(n * log n)`.

#### **2. Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Example**

Standard multiplication of two 2x2 matrices takes 8 multiplications.


Strassen's method does it with only **7 multiplications** by creating clever intermediate matrices (`P1` to `P7`). This reduction from 8 to 7 leads to a complexity of `O(n^log₂(7)) ≈ O(n^2.81)` instead of `O(n³)`.

For two matrices A and B:
`P1 = A11 * (B12 - B22)`
`P2 = (A11 + A12) * B22`
`P3 = (A21 + A22) * B11`
`P4 = A22 * (B21 - B11)`
`P5 = (A11 + A22) * (B11 + B22)`
`P6 = (A12 - A22) * (B21 + B22)`
`P7 = (A11 - A21) * (B11 + B12)`

The final matrix C is calculated as:
`C11 = P5 + P4 - P2 + P6`
`C12 = P1 + P2`
`C21 = P3 + P4`
`C22 = P5 + P1 - P3 - P7`

You don't need to memorize the formulas, but you **must understand the principle**: reducing the number of recursive calls (multiplications) at the cost of more additions/subtractions leads to a better asymptotic complexity.

#### **3. Sum of Subsets Example (Backtracking)**

**Problem:** Given set `S = {3, 5, 6, 7}` and target `d = 15`, find all subsets that sum to 15.

We build a state-space tree. A node represents a decision to include or not include the next element.

1.  **Start with empty set {}. Current sum = 0.**
2.  **Consider '3':**
    *   **Path 1 (Include 3):** `Current sum = 3`. Next element is '5'.
        *   **Consider '5':**
            *   **Path 1.1 (Include 5):** `Current sum = 3+5 = 8`. Next element '6'.
                *   **Consider '6':**
                    *   **Path 1.1.1 (Include 6):** `Sum = 8+6 = 14`. Next '7'. `14+7 > 15`. Prune.
                    *   **Path 1.1.2 (Exclude 6):** `Sum = 8`. Next '7'. `8+7 = 15`. **Solution Found: {3, 5, 7}**. Backtrack.
            *   **Path 1.2 (Exclude 5):** `Current sum = 3`. Next '6'.
                *   **Consider '6':**
                    *   **Path 1.2.1 (Include 6):** `Sum = 3+6 = 9`. Next '7'. `9+7 > 15`. Prune.
                    *   **Path 1.2.2 (Exclude 6):** `Sum = 3`. Next '7'. `3+7 < 15`. End of set. Prune.
    *   **Path 2 (Exclude 3):** `Current sum = 0`. Next '5'.
        *   **Consider '5':**
            *   **Path 2.1 (Include 5):** `Sum = 5`. Next '6'.
                *   **Consider '6':**
                    *   **Path 2.1.1 (Include 6):** `Sum = 5+6=11`. Next '7'. `11+7 > 15`. Prune.
                    *   **Path 2.1.2 (Exclude 6):** `Sum = 5`. Next '7'. `5+7 < 15`. Prune.
            *   **Path 2.2 (Exclude 5):** `Sum = 0`. Next '6'.
                *   ...and so on.

The only solution found is **{3, 5, 7}**.

#### **4. Graph Colouring Example (Backtracking)**

**Problem:** Color the following graph with the minimum number of colors (m). Let's try `m=3` (Red, Green, Blue).



1.  **Start at A.** Color A **Red**.
2.  **Move to B.** B is adjacent to A (Red). Color B **Green**.
3.  **Move to C.** C is adjacent to A (Red) and B (Green). Color C **Blue**.
4.  **Move to D.** D is adjacent to B (Green) and C (Blue). We can color D **Red**.
5.  **Move to E.** E is adjacent to A (Red), C (Blue), and D (Red). We can color E **Green**.

**Solution:** Yes, it is possible with 3 colors. A=Red, B=Green, C=Blue, D=Red, E=Green.

If we had tried with `m=2`, we would have failed. For example, after A=Red, B=Green, C would be adjacent to both Red and Green, leaving no color options. We would have to backtrack and try a different coloring for B, which would also fail, proving `m=2` is not possible.

#### **5. Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) Example (Branch and Bound)**

This is complex, so let's focus on the principle.
**Problem:** Find the shortest tour for the graph below, starting and ending at A.


**Branch and Bound Approach:**
1.  **Calculate Initial Bound:** Find a lower bound for the cost. A simple one is to sum the two cheapest edges from each vertex, divided by 2. This is not a tour, but no tour can be cheaper.
2.  **Explore Nodes:** Start at A. We can go to B, C, or D.
    *   **Path A -> B:** Cost is 10. Now, calculate a new lower bound for a path starting with A-B. The new bound must include the cost 10 and a cost for a path from B to C, D and back to A.
    *   **Path A -> C:** Cost is 15. Calculate a lower bound for a path starting with A-C.
    *   **Path A -> D:** Cost is 20. Calculate a lower bound for a path starting with A-D.
3.  **Pruning:** Let's say we explore A->B->C->D->A and find a full tour with cost 80. This is our current "best solution". Now, if we are exploring another path, say A->D, and its *lower bound* (the minimum possible cost from this point) is calculated to be 85, we can **prune** this entire branch. There's no need to explore A->D further because it can *never* be better than the 80 we've already found.

The algorithm always explores the node with the lowest bound first, hoping to find a good solution quickly to enable more pruning.

#### **6. Huffman Coding Example (Greedy)**

**Problem:** Encode the string "BCAADDBBA"
1.  **Calculate Frequencies:** A: 4, B: 3, C: 1, D: 2.
2.  **Build the Tree:**
    *   Start with each character as a leaf node with its frequency.
    *   Repeatedly take the two nodes with the **lowest frequency**, merge them into a new parent node whose frequency is their sum.
    *   **Step 1:** C(1) and D(2) are lowest. Merge them into a node with frequency 3.
    *   **Step 2:** Now we have B(3), A(4), and [C,D](3). Take B(3) and [C,D](3). Merge them into a node with frequency 6.
    *   **Step 3:** We have A(4) and [[C,D],B](6). Merge them. The root has frequency 10 (total characters).
3.  **Assign Codes:** Traverse the tree from the root. Assign '0' to the left branch and '1' to the right branch (or vice-versa, consistently).



*   **A:** 1
*   **B:** 01
*   **C:** 000
*   **D:** 001

The greedy choice at each step was to merge the two least frequent nodes.

#### **7. Activity Selection Problem Example (Greedy)**

**Problem:** Select the max number of non-overlapping activities from the list below.
Activities: `(start, finish)`
A1(1, 4), A2(3, 5), A3(0, 6), A4(5, 7), A5(3, 9), A6(5, 9), A7(6, 10), A8(8, 11), A9(8, 12), A10(2, 14), A11(12, 16)

1.  **Greedy Strategy:** Sort the activities by their **finish time**.
    A1(1, 4), A2(3, 5), A3(0, 6), A4(5, 7), A7(6, 10), A8(8, 11), A9(8, 12), A11(12, 16)
    *(Removed A5, A6, A10 for clarity as they are dominated by others)*
2.  **Select:**
    *   Pick the first activity, **A1 (1, 4)**. Last finish time is 4.
    *   Find the next activity that starts after 4. That is **A4 (5, 7)**. Select it. Last finish time is 7.
    *   Find the next activity that starts after 7. That is **A8 (8, 11)**. Select it. Last finish time is 11.
    *   Find the next activity that starts after 11. That is **A11 (12, 16)**. Select it. Last finish time is 16.
3.  **Solution:** The selected activities are **{A1, A4, A8, A11}**. A total of 4 activities.

#### **8. Dijkstra's Algorithm (SSSP) Example**

**Problem:** Find the shortest path from source A to all other nodes.


**Initialization:**
*   `dist` = {A: 0, B: ∞, C: ∞, D: ∞, E: ∞}
*   `visited` = {}
*   `priority_queue` = {A:0}

**Steps:**
1.  **V
